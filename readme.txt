A multisite plugin to show plugin activations across all your sites.

This plugin was designed to let you know a little bit more about what plugins your users are running on your multisite install. It's useful it you're trying to clean up unused plugins, or determine plugin popularity.

1.  Unzip the file into a folder on your hard drive
1.  Upload the `/multisite-plugin-stats/` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` folder on your site
1.  Visit *Network Admin -> Plugins* and *Network Activate* it there.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why would I use this? =

Well, I can only tell you why I use it. You are your own person, and have to make your own decisions! Occasionally I like to clean out the plugins that no one is using, or try to get users migrate to plugins that do something better. This helps me accomplish that.
